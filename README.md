# Estimation and Visualization of Canton-Level Moods using Hybrid Fine-Grained Emotion Analysis Methodologies

### Abstract
The increasing availability of geolocated data in social media opened new ventures in the exploration and understanding of spatio-temporal movements patterns and possibilities to explain such irregularities in the mobility data. Twitter offers both individual and crowd-based geotagged data at different levels of precision.  

The main objective of this project is to understand what triggers mobility in Switzerland by estimating how emotions of users change from one canton to another based on spatio-temporal data. We have followed fine-grained emotion recognition methodology and developped a platform for visualizing happiness in the swiss cantons to provide users and the general public with an interactive interface for mood pattern exploration using multiple time, space and user dimensions. 


### Data Description
Geotagged tweets in the Swiss area collected from Twitter.

### Feasibility and Risks
One of the limitations that we are currently thinking of is the possibility that the geotagged tweets are generated by a small minority of the population, which might lead to a bias in any inference that we will make using this data (representation issues). This will be clear once we get our hands dirty and start looking into the data.

### Deliverables


* Hybrid rule based and learning based extending Lexicon Based for Fine-Grained Emotion Detection in Tweets. 
* Interactive interface for visualization of canton-level moods with multiple time dimensions and useful information about users and density of tweets.

### Note
This is a tentative plan, the Deliverables and the Timeplan might change a little bit as we start working on the project and exploring the data. We will adjust this proposal if we decide to make some changes.
