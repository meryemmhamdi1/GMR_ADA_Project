### Abstract
This goal of the project is to build a platform for capturing sentiments and emotions expressed using twitter in swiss cantons. The platform uses Twitter as a data source and combines sentiment analysis, Hybrid Fine-Grained Emotion Analysis Methodologies, and visualization techniques in order to provide users with an interactive interface for data exploration.

This platform provides interactive maps in order to give users the possibility to have a comprehensive overview of the sentiment and emotion analysis results about Swiss cantons  and with the opportunity to zoom in to a specific canton to visualize the distribution of emotions and sentiment during a specific time.

The platform allows users to tune their view on such  huge amount of information and to interactively reduce the inherent complexity, possibly providing a hint for finding meaningful patterns, and correlation between moods/emotion and time.


### Data Description
Geotagged tweets in the Swiss area collected from Twitter.


### Feasibility and Risks
One of the limitations that we are currently thinking of is the possibility that the geotagged tweets are generated by a small minority of the population, which might lead to a bias in any inference that we will make using this data (representation issues). This will be clear once we get our hands dirty and start looking into the data.

### Deliverables


* Hybrid rule based and learning based extending Lexicon Based for Fine-Grained Emotion Detection in Tweets. 
* Interactive interface for visualization of canton-level moods with multiple time dimensions and useful information about users and density of tweets.
